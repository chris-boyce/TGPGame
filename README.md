# TGPGame
My Branch of The TPG Level 5 Group Project :). 
This project is a zombie wave shooter inspired by games such as Boxhead. During this time I got to work on alot of different systems and learn alot
Anything to Animation and Ragdolls. To Gun Inheritence and Interfaces which is the first time I used them.
Also the game design side was thought about making each zombie and gun feel different to make a unique game experience
